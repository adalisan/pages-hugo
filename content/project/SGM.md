This variant of the graph matching problem provides an opportunity for the application of JOFC and also the adaptation of a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm.
My work on this variant of the graph matching problem constituted part of my dissertation research. This work is presented in [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0367) and [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3813http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3813) arxiv papers.
