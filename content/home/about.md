# Biography

I am a machine learning researcher at Raytheon BBN Technologies. I have worked on computer vision, bioinformatics and statistical analysis problems. I am interested in different approaches to learning from disparate modalities of  data collected from different sensors. I am also interested in applications of data fusion  to graphs and in general, learning from graph data.

I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University. My PhD advisor was Carey Priebe. We have worked on projects involving data in dissimilarity representation in addition to graphs. My dissertation research involved using dissimilarity data from disparate sources in order to solve learning problems. These type of problems are examples of multiview learning and my approach is a dissimilarity-centric method to find a common representation for the disparate data from different views. An extension of my approach allows the solution of the seeded graph matching problem, a variant of the graph matching problem where a portion of the vertex correspondences are known.


I also have a M.Sc in Engineering from Brown University. I worked in computer vision problems at [LEMS lab](http://vision.lems.brown.edu/).

Also at Johns Hopkins (2007-2009), I was a research assistant in the Cardiovascular Research Grid project, developed code for predicting sudden cardiac death or VT/VF events for people implanted with ICD devices.

In addition to becoming familiar with different statistical methods, I also try to gain as much computing skills as I can. Learning R was an arduous journey and I learned to love R at the end by repeatedly failing and occasionally succeding. See the [software](#software) section for the R packages I am working on. 

I also work with Matlab and Python for scientific computing. Here's my [github page](https://github.com/adalisan/) by the way.

I like learning new things and solving practical data problems. My two career goals have been to improve my software development skills and learn about new mathematical methods and approaches. You could also say I am a typeface and design enthusiast.

Like the best of statistics/data science practitioners, I am adept at learning new computer languages.

I used  C++  for a long time working with [VXL](https://github.com/vxl/vxl) library. I picked up Python during my PhD which I would say is my (current) favorite computer language.
