Genomics, Gene Expression and DNA arrays
\url{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10866209/}

*Posed Problem: A review of recent improvements in the fields of bioinformatics, genomic research and overview of exciting possibilities in the future.
*Methodology:
Reviews  of and comments on most popular methods in gene expression  experiments, expression monitoring, discovery experiments, examples of transcription regulation, usage of profiles for "fingerprinting" applications, experiments using small amount of biomaterials, solving regulatory networks problems, representation of knowledge obtained from  genomic experiments.
Strong points of the article are its clear organization, its comprehensive scanning literature, its understandable language(with exceptions). I found the article too optimistic in that it doesn't consider any "chokepoint" problems in the field basically those might not be solved satisfactorily for a long time. Also the language in  some of the figure footnotes were too technical, not easily understandable by someone who didn't have lab experience.
